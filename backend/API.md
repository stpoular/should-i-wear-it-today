# API

## Overview

* A RESTful API built using **FastAPI** that enables users to manage their accounts, add and update items, and submit comments on those items. The backend utilizes **Google Firestore** as the database, and **JWT tokens** are used for secure authentication. This system supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for users, items, and submissions.

## Features

- **User Authentication:**
  - Register new users with a unique username, email, and password.
  - Login and authenticate via JWT tokens.
  - View and update current user information.
  - Delete user accounts.
  
- **Item Management:**
  - Add new items with attributes such as name and color.
  - Retrieve all items belonging to the authenticated user.
  - Update or delete items.

- **Submission System:**
  - Add comments (submissions) related to items.
  - View, update, and delete submissions for the authenticated user.

## Tech stack

- **FastAPI**: Web framework for building the API.
- **Pydantic**: Data validation with Pydantic models.
- **Google Firestore**: NoSQL cloud database for user, item, and submission data storage.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Secure user authentication and token management.
- **Passlib**: Password hashing and verification.
